# Yatzy Game

## Overview
Welcome to Yatzy! This is a dice game where players aim to roll specific combinations to score the highest points. Yatzy is similar to other dice games like Yahtzee but has its own unique rules and scoring patterns.

## Game Rules
Yatzy is played with five dice, and players take turns rolling them up to three times per turn. The objective is to score points by achieving different combinations, such as pairs, three-of-a-kinds, or straights. The game can be played solo or with multiple players, and the person with the highest score at the end wins!

### Basic Rules:
1. Each player rolls five dice.
2. Players can choose to keep or re-roll any dice up to two additional times.
3. After three rolls (or earlier, if satisfied), the player selects a scoring category.
4. Each scoring category can be used only once per game.

### Scoring Categories:
- **Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes**: Score the sum of dice showing the chosen number.
- **Pair**: Two dice of the same number.
- **Two Pairs**: Two different pairs of dice.
- **Three of a Kind**: Three dice of the same number.
